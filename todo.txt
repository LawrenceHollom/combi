 == INSTRUCTIONS ==
 - Add more complex random graph constructions
 - Add computation of path cover number (have java code for this?)

 == THE KITCHEN SINK ==
 - Maybe add option for increasing by number of edges or something
 - test with sink((size>0)&&(theta>=acyclic)) -> halts at n=15

 == ITERATOR ==
 - Detect identical nodes in graphs and iterate over subsets more efficiently
 - e.g. there are only 3 ways to pick 2 vertices from K_{s,t}

 == BUNKBEDS ==
  - The code is very (very) slow, and naive. Should be some wins to be had in terms of speed
  - Add option to bunkbed sim to choose level of precision (maybe as a power of 2 or something)
  - Test hypothesis about number of ways with paths of length bdd by given even extra dist

 == BUGS ==
 - Maybe ->() has stopped working? Gets picked up as infix-like

 == TREE CONSTRUCTOR ==
 - Allow manual entry of a specific tree

 == PLANARITY ==
 - This seems like the best lead: http://www.mathe2.uni-bayreuth.de/EWS/demoucron.pdf
 - Consider passing an of_filter graph into is_component_planar_rec

 == INTERVAL COLOURINGS ==
 - This is slow; can't run K(7) in about a minute (then gave up)
 - Seems to be some threshold number of edges where it gets very slow.

 == KEEP CLIPPY HAPPY ==
 - You don't want to anger clippy.

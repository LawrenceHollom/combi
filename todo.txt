 == INSTRUCTIONS ==
 - Add more complex random graph constructions
 - Add computation of path cover number (have java code for this?)

 == MERGE REPEATS AND CONSTRUCTIONS ==
 - Inefficiency if a bool operation is shared between the stop condition and the print conditions

 == THE KITCHEN SINK ==
 - Add option to test hypothesis via a big list of graphs; basically just try everything in increasing order order
 -- Maybe option for increasing size order?

 == ITERATOR ==
 - Detect identical nodes in graphs and iterate over subsets more efficiently
 - e.g. there are only 3 ways to pick 2 vertices from K_{s,t}

 == BUNKBEDS ==
  - The code is very (very) slow, and naive. Should be some wins to be had in terms of speed

 == BUGS ==
 - Awkward crash when asking for e.g. rrb(4,2); something goes oob

 == G(n,p) SIMULATOR ==
 - Want to be able to answer questions otf "When does the giant component emerge?"
 - But for arbitrary functions of the graph
 - Output is a big table of values p/threshold -> value
 - So need to know the threshold expression; e.g. for giant component care about p * n.
 - Need:
 -- FloatOperation
 -- Tabulate construction (assume we always want to do this with G(n,p))

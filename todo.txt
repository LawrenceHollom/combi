 == INSTRUCTIONS ==
 - Add grid graphs
 - Add product graphs (all kinds of products)
 - Add more complex random graph constructions
 - Add computation of path cover number (have java code for this?)
 - Option run until either an upper bound of a graph is found safing a condition (which is also printed)

 == THE KITCHEN SINK ==
 - Add option to test hypothesis via a big list of graphs; basically just try everything in increasing order order
 -- Maybe option for increasing size order?

 == BUNKBEDS ==
 - Add the up/down bunkbed which runs in 2^|E| time
 - Move code to actually print polynomials out of percolate and into bunkbed

 == ITERATOR ==
 - Detect identical nodes in graphs and iterate over subsets more efficiently
 - e.g. there are only 3 ways to pick 2 vertices from K_{s,t}

 == BUGS ==
 - C(2) has incorrect degrees (they should be 1)

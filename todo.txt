 == THE BIG REFACTOR ==
 - Make everything more typeful. More typeful!
 -- Vertex type
 -- Actually use Edge type everywhere
 -- Come up with and use more types as appropriate.
 -- Remove the Order type; it does nothing, and a usize genuinely works.
 - Remove all the 2.pow type things; use << instead.
 
 == THE KITCHEN SINK ==
 - Maybe add option for increasing by number of edges or something
 - test with sink((size>0)&&(theta>=acyclic)) -> halts at n=15
 - Test fewer graphs for the very big n -> if more than 1000 then filter randomly
 - Only run arrow commands on successful graphs (as in until)

 == BOWTIES ==
 - Check that struct(bowties(d),num) agrees with old bowties framework
 - Then rip out old framework.

 == THOMASSEN CHECKER ==
 - Every cubic graph can be two-edge-coloured as linear forests.
 -- At least how long must the parts be?
 -- Other than the two cubic graphs of degree 6.
 - Need the general edge framework first.

 == DOMINATION ==
 - Optimistic: either through construction or otherwise, notice when a graph has
   a small set of edges which split the graph into two parts. Then dp over these.
 - Use case is probably cubic graphs, and sets of three edges (as graphs will be
   just barely 3-connected.)
 - If done correctly then can compute domination numbers for very large graphs.

 == FLOOD FILL ==
 - Code up a generic flood fill algo; it comes up so much.
 - Adding what stops the flood fill will be the difficult bit.
 - This needs the generic edge framework for this to be feasible.

 == HOUSE OF GRAPHS ==
 - Have a new kitchen sink option for smashing through houseofgraphs
 -- Work this in with the old one in some sensible way.

 == ITERATOR ==
 - Detect identical nodes in graphs and iterate over subsets more efficiently
 - e.g. there are only 3 ways to pick 2 vertices from K_{s,t}

 == BUNKBEDS ==
 - The code is very (very) slow, and naive. Should be some wins to be had in terms of speed
 - Instead of iterating through all subsets of edges, dfs:
 -- Then once both endpoints are in, can cut off immediately.
 -- Should speed things up a little.

 == BUGS ==
 - Maybe ->() has stopped working? Gets picked up as infix-like
 - sink(domination>10) doesn't trip on E(11)

 == HELP COMMAND ==
 - Print all the various operations.
 - And write code to do this automatically so it doesn't need maintaining.

== UNIT COMMANDS ==
- signature: prints out all kinds of info about the graph

 == KEEP CLIPPY HAPPY ==
 - You don't want to anger clippy.

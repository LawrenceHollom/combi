 == INSTRUCTIONS ==
 - Add more complex random graph constructions
 - Add computation of path cover number (have java code for this?)
 - Add size of largest clique (omega) and independence number (alpha)

 == THE KITCHEN SINK ==
 - Add option to test hypothesis via a big list of graphs; basically just try everything in increasing order order
 -- Maybe option for increasing size order?

 == ITERATOR ==
 - Detect identical nodes in graphs and iterate over subsets more efficiently
 - e.g. there are only 3 ways to pick 2 vertices from K_{s,t}

 == BUNKBEDS ==
  - The code is very (very) slow, and naive. Should be some wins to be had in terms of speed

 == BUGS ==
 - Awkward crash when asking for e.g. rrb(4,2); something goes oob

 == PARSERS FAIL FOR COMPLEX CONSTRUCTIONS ==
 - Need to replace ".contains" commands in instruction.rs with proper tree-parsing.

 == TREE CONSTRUCTOR ==
 - Allow manual entry of a specific tree
 - Hack in a max degree condition (an optional argument at the end of the controller)

 == BOOL OPERATIONS ==
 - Add logical connectives
 - Will run into copy issues.
